# The 11th Floor 🏢🔦

**The 11th Floor** is a procedural liminal horror and investigation game. Players take on the role of a Night Surveyor in a corporate skyscraper that is physically impossible. The horror is derived not from monsters or jump scares, but from spatial inconsistency, isolation, and the realization that the environment is sentient.

## 👁️ Design Pillars
* **Architectural Gaslighting:** The environment actively changes to make the player doubt their own memory and orientation.
* **The Horror of the Mundane:** High-contrast between supernatural geometry and boring bureaucratic tasks (filing, measuring).
* **Technical Mystery:** Using logical tools like scanners and blueprints to quantify the unquantifiable.

## 🛠️ Technical Overview
* **Platform:** PC (Custom Java-based engine).
* **Engine Focus:** Robust 2D array grid systems and "Lazy Loaded Geometry."
* **Core Loop:** Observe (Scan) → Verify (Traverse) → Document (Log Anomalies) → Stabilize (Maintain Sanity) → Descend/Ascend.

## 🕹️ Core Mechanics
* **The Surveyor's Tool:** A handheld scanner showing a 2D wireframe grid. Players use it to find discrepancies between digital data and physical reality.
* **The Grounding Meter:** A sanity system that degrades when witnessing anomalies. It must be restored by performing mundane "Anchor" tasks like sorting files or syncing clocks.
* **Non-Euclidean Logic:** Paths behind the player are replaced or warped once they move off-screen, creating a sentient, manipulative layout.
