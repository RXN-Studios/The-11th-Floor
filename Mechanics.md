# Gameplay Systems & Mechanics

## 1. The Surveyor's Tool (Scanner)
The Scanner is the primary interface for quantifying the impossible environment of the skyscraper.
* **Measurement Mode:** Allows the player to "ping" a room to see its metadata (e.g., "Room 402: 12m x 8m").
* **Discrepancy Detection:** If the player physically walks 13 steps but the tool reports 12m, they must "Lock" the anomaly to earn points and progress.

## 2. The Grounding Meter (Sanity)
This meter tracks the player's psychological stability.
* **Degradation:** The meter drops when the player witnesses anomalies or spends too much time in non-Euclidean hallways.
* **Low Grounding Effects:** Causes "Visual Tearing" (flickering walls), audio hallucinations (distant office chatter), and more aggressive layout shifts.
* **Restoration (Anchor Points):** Players must perform mundane tasks to "ground" themselves, such as syncing wall clocks or sorting disorganized files.

## 3. Architectural Anomalies
Anomalies are the "enemies" of the game, categorized by their logic-defying nature:
* **Spatial Discrepancies:** Rooms that are physically different sizes than their blueprints suggest.
* **Non-Euclidean Loops:** Hallways that lead back to the start despite only having right turns.
* **Sentient Architecture:** The "Turn-Around" Script—if a player moves in a straight line without turning the camera, the path behind them is replaced with a wall or a new room.

## 4. The Core Loop
1. **Observe:** Scan the floor layout with the Digital Tool.
2. **Verify:** Physically traverse the space to confirm dimensions.
3. **Document:** Log "Architectural Anomalies" to earn progress.
4. **Stabilize:** Maintain the Grounding Meter via mundane tasks.
5. **Ascend/Descend:** Once enough anomalies are logged, the elevator becomes functional.
