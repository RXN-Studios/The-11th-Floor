# World Building & Aesthetics

## 🏢 The Aethelgard Mystery
Through scattered memos, players uncover the history of **Aethelgard Spatial Solutions**, a corporation that attempted to build an office space that "occupies the space between seconds."

## 🎨 Aesthetics & Atmosphere
* **Visuals:** Low-fidelity, high-contrast office aesthetics. A palette of corporate beige, grey, and cold blue.
* **Audio:** Diegetic sound focus—the constant hum of fluorescent lights, the rhythmic thud of footsteps on carpet, and the "wrong" silence of empty spaces.
* **The 11th Floor:** A recurring "glitch" floor that acts as a central hub or a point of maximum intensity for anomalies.

## 🗺️ Procedural Themes
Each floor is generated based on a specific corporate theme:
* **The Infinite Cubicle Farm**
* **The Sunless Atrium**
* **The File Labyrinth**
